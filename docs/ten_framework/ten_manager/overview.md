# APTIMA Manager

In the APTIMA ecosystem, almost everything is a component. For example, a APTIMA app is a type of component, a APTIMA extension is another type, and a APTIMA protocol is yet another. To assist APTIMA developers in managing all operations related to these components, there is a crucial tool called the APTIMA Manager.

The APTIMA Manager includes a APTIMA package manager, designed to simplify the management of APTIMA packages. This package manager handles tasks such as determining which dependency packages are necessary, fetching those dependencies, and installing them. In short, the APTIMA Manager streamlines the process of creating new APTIMA packages from scratch and makes it easier to install APTIMA packages from the APTIMA Cloud Store.
