# App

App is the container in the APTIMA world, containing groups and extensions.
App can function as a process placed inside a Docker container (primarily used in the cloud).
App can also function as a thread embedded within an existing app (on client or server).
â‡’ APTIMA can perform localized modifications (minor enhancements) on an existing project without requiring the entire project to be rewritten according to APTIMA.
