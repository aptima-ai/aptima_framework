APTIMA - a framework to create conversational agents.

## Features

The Aptima Framework offers the following advantages:

1. **High-Performance Multimodal Interactions in Real Time**

   For AI applications involving complex audio-visual scenarios, the Aptima Framework is your optimal solution. It provides exceptional performance and low latency, with extensive optimization of interactions across extensions to streamline the development of cutting-edge AI applications.

2. **Broad Language and Platform Compatibility**

   Developers can create modular and reusable extensions using widely-used programming languages such as C++, Go, and Python, with future support for JavaScript/TypeScript. The Aptima Framework is designed to run seamlessly on a variety of platforms, including Windows, Mac, Linux, and mobile devices.

3. **Seamless Edge-to-Cloud Integration**

   The Aptima Framework makes it easy to combine extensions deployed across edge and cloud environments, enabling diverse use cases. For privacy-focused edge deployments, smaller models utilize local computing resources to reduce costs and latency, while cloud-based large models can be integrated for a perfect blend of performance and cost-effectiveness.

4. **Breaking the Limits of Large Models**

   The Aptima Framework enables the creation of sophisticated AI applications that surpass the limitations of standalone large models. Developers can design custom agents using an intuitive drag-and-drop programming interface, while also integrating AI with audio-visual tools, databases, monitoring systems, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and more.

5. **RDynamic Real-Time State Management**

   The Aptima Framework supports real-time agent state management, allowing AI agents to dynamically adapt and respond to changes, ensuring optimal performance in dynamic scenarios.
